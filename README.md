This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of total nervous system health loss from 37 distinct conditions estimated in the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study. We present estimates by condition and for the aggregate globally, regionally, and by country. This code was used for the manuscript's custom analysis to produce prevalence, deaths, Years Lived with Disability, Years of Life Lost, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years estimates for nervous system health loss due to each condition and aggregated across all conditions. Thescripts produces these measures for each of the 37 conditions, creates a prevalence aggregate including a comorbidity correction, calculates percent change and sex ratios, creates custom age aggregates, and produces population-attributable fractions for risk factors. The article "Global, regional, and national burden of disorders affecting the nervous system, 1990â€“2021: a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021" was published in the Lancet Neurology.
